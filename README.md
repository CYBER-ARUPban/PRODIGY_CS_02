# PRODIGY_CS_02
This project is a simple yet effective image encryption tool that secures images using pixel manipulation techniques. Instead of traditional cryptographic methods, this tool modifies pixel values by applying transformations such as swapping, shifting, or mathematical operations based on a user-provided key. The encryption process alters the image in a way that makes it unreadable without the correct key, while the decryption process reverses these transformations to restore the original image. It supports widely used image formats like PNG, JPG, and BMP, ensuring broad compatibility. Built using Python, it utilizes libraries such as Pillow and NumPy for efficient image processing. The tool is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, allowing users to protect their images with minimal effort. Future enhancements may include more advanced encryption techniques, such as integrating AES encryption for additional security, and developing a graphical user interface to improve user experience.
